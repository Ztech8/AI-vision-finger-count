# Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV and HandTrackingModule

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library along with the HandTrackingModule to perform hand gesture recognition through a webcam feed. It detects a hand in the video stream and determines the status of fingers, allowing for gesture-based interaction.

## Dependencies

- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/): `pip install opencv-python`
- [cvzone](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone): A library that contains the HandTrackingModule. Make sure to install it according to its documentation.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install cvzone
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python finger_count_project.py
    ```

3. Use the 'q' key to exit the application.

## Features

- Hand detection with a confidence threshold of 0.8.
- Allows tracking of only one hand in the video stream.
- Recognizes the status of each finger (0 for closed, 1 for open).
- Displays a message when all fingers are closed.

## Controls

- Press 'q' to exit the application.
